This directory contains scripts that allow you to quickly deploy PingFederate, PingAccess,
Quickstart apps, Integration Kits and the OAuth playground in various combinations.

It will save you from manually unzipping files, copying license files, starting the
server, accepting the license, flipping through default config screens, etc. Basically 
avoiding all of the manual steps required to get a working setup for a Ping Identity
product with sample applications.

The idea is that you drop all of the .zip files needed (eg. PingFederate distribution,
Quickstart distribution, license file) in to a single directory and then call the
appropriate deployment script from that directory. The exact versions of these
distributions don't matter, the scripts should be version agnostic.

The scripts (for detailed instructions consult the documentation at the top of each script):

pf-deploy-common.sh:
 this is a utility/helper script that is included from the other scripts, not meant to
 be called directly from the command line

pf-deploy-quickstart.sh:
 deploys PingFederate (pingfederate-x.x.x.zip) and the Quickstart
 (pf-quickstart-x-x.zip) sample applications
 
pf-deploy-oauth-playground.sh:
 deploys PingFederate (pingfederate-x.x.x.zip), the OAuth 2.0 Playground
 (OAuthPlayground-x.x.x.zip) and the Java Integration Kit (pf-Java-integration-kit-x.x.x.zip)
 (the latter is required by the OAuth Playground)
 depends on pf-deploy-java-ik.sh as well as pf-deploy-common.sh

pf-deploy-agentless-ik.sh:
 deploys PingFederate (pingfederate-x.x.x.zip) and the Agentless Integration Kit
 plus the sample IDP/SP applications in there
 
pf-deploy-java-ik.sh:
 deploys PingFederate (pingfederate-x.x.x.zip) and the Java Integration Kit
 (pf-Java-integration-kit-x.x.x.zip) plus the sample IDP/SP applications in there
 
pa-deploy-quickstart.sh:
 deploys PingAccess ((pingaccess-x.x.x.zip), PingFederate (pingfederate-x.x.x.zip) and
 the PingAccess Quickstart applications (pingaccess-quickstart-x.x.x.zip)
